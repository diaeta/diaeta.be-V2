# Agent Procedures

These rules compile expectations extracted from the source documents stored in `rules/_attachments/`. They MUST be reviewed before each delivery.

1. Project onboarding (refer to `Comprehensive Dietitian Practice Assessment.pdf` and `Multilingual Dietitian Website Voice & Style Guide.pdf`)
   - Maintain an empathy-first tone while staying evidence-based.
   - Validate medical claims with the lead dietitian prior to publication.
   - Ensure every language version is reviewed by a native speaker or professional translator.

2. Collaboration & workflow (refer to `Website Optimization Protocol Development_.pdf`)
   - Follow the editorial workflow: medical validation ? SEO review ? translation ? QA.
   - Log changes and rationale so future contributors can audit the decision trail.
   - Keep automation notes in `docs/ELEVENTY_AUTOMATION_NOTES.md`.

3. Creativity & brand consistency (refer to `THE ART AND SCIENCE OF DIGITAL CREATIVITY.docx`, `The Science and Art of Creative Thinking_ A Compre.pdf`)
   - Apply brand personality consistently across languages.
   - Document any creative experiment before deployment (A/B ideas, campaign variations).

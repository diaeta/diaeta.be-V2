Starting your day with a healthy breakfast can set the tone for successful weight loss. Here are some ideas and tips to help you enjoy your mornings while supporting your goals.

## 1. Overnight Oats with Berries

Combine rolled oats, low-fat milk or a plant-based alternative, chia seeds, and fresh berries. Prepare the night before for a quick, fiber-rich breakfast.

## 2. Greek Yogurt Parfait

Layer Greek yogurt with sliced fruit, a sprinkle of nuts, and a drizzle of honey. This provides protein, healthy fats, and natural sweetness.

## 3. Veggie Omelette

Whisk eggs with spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms. Cook in a non-stick pan for a filling, low-calorie meal.

## 4. Whole Grain Toast with Avocado

Top whole grain toast with mashed avocado, a squeeze of lemon, and a pinch of chili flakes. Add a poached egg for extra protein.

## 5. Smoothie Bowl

Blend spinach, banana, frozen berries, and a scoop of protein powder. Pour into a bowl and top with seeds and sliced fruit.

**Tip:** Choose breakfasts that are high in fiber and protein to keep you full longer and avoid mid-morning cravings.

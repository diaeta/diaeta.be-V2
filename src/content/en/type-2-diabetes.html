                <h2>Understanding Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
                <p>Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, meaning a level of sugar (glucose) that is too high in the blood. This situation occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin (the hormone that regulates blood sugar) or when the body's cells become resistant to insulin's action (insulin resistance).</p>
                <p>Over time, uncontrolled hyperglycemia can lead to serious complications, affecting the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and the cardiovascular system. That's why proactive management is essential.</p>

                <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Risk Factors and the Role of Lifestyle</h3>
                <p>Several factors can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, including:</p>
                <ul class="list-styled">
                    <li>Being overweight or obese (especially excess abdominal fat).</li>
                    <li>A sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity.</li>
                    <li>An unbalanced diet, high in refined sugars and unhealthy fats.</li>
                    <li>A family history of diabetes.</li>
                    <li>Age (the risk increases with age).</li>
                    <li>Certain ethnic origins.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The good news is that many factors, particularly those related to lifestyle and diet, are modifiable.</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle" style="max-width: 850px; margin: 0 auto;">
            Diet plays a central and powerful role in managing type 2 diabetes. A suitable nutritional strategy can help control blood sugar, improve insulin sensitivity, manage weight, reduce associated cardiovascular risk factors, and, in some cases, lead to remission or a reduction in medication (always under medical supervision).

                    <h4>Carbohydrate Control</h4>
                    <p>This isn't about eliminating carbohydrates, but about choosing the right sources (complex, fiber-rich) and managing portions to avoid blood sugar spikes. At Diaeta, we teach you to identify these good sources and integrate them into tasty and balanced meals suited to your daily life, so that managing carbohydrates becomes a simple habit, not a constraint.</p>

                    <h4>Richness in Fiber</h4>
                    <p>Fiber (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes) slows the absorption of glucose, improves satiety, and contributes to digestive and cardiovascular health. We help you discover simple and delicious ways to increase your daily fiber intake, incorporating a variety of foods you will enjoy, for better glycemic control and lasting satiety.</p>

                    <h4>Choosing Healthy Fats</h4>
                    <p>Favoring unsaturated fats (vegetable oils, avocados, nuts, fatty fish) over saturated and trans fats is beneficial for insulin sensitivity and heart health. With Diaeta, you will learn to integrate these beneficial fats into your daily meals in an appetizing way, discovering healthy alternatives that don't sacrifice taste, for better metabolic and cardiovascular health.</p>

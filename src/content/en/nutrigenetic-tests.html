                <h2 style="color: var(--primary-700);">Nutrigenetics: Science at the Heart of Your Plate</h2>
                <p>Nutrigenetics is a branch of science that studies how our individual genes influence our response to diet. Although we share the majority of our genetic code, subtle differences (polymorphisms) explain why we do not all react in the same way to nutrients, foods, or certain diets.</p>
                <p>These genetic variations can impact:</p>
                <ul class="list-styled-check">
                    <li>Your metabolism of macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) and therefore your relative needs for weight management or performance.</li>
                    <li>Your specific needs for certain vitamins and minerals (e.g., efficiency of vitamin A conversion, needs for folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D).</li>
                    <li>Your sensitivity to dietary compounds like caffeine, lactose, or gluten.</li>
                    <li>Predispositions related to weight management (e.g., perception of the taste of fats, tendency to snack) and cardiovascular health (e.g., response to sodium, types of fats).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thanks to nutrigenetic tests, we analyze more than 70 genetic markers to obtain valuable information, allowing us to refine your nutritional plan far beyond general recommendations. The goal is to optimize your diet in a targeted, preventive, and deeply personalized way.</p>

                <h4>1. Preliminary Consultation</h4>
                <p>During a consultation, Pierre Abou-Zeid evaluates with you the relevance of a nutrigenetic test based on your health goals, your history, and your questions. He explains the ins and outs for an informed decision.</p>

                <h4>2. Simple Saliva Collection</h4>
                <p>The test is simple and non-invasive: a saliva sample is collected using a collection kit. This kit can be given to you at the clinic, or arrangements can be discussed for easy collection.</p>

                <h4>4. Interpretation & Diaeta Action Plan</h4>
                <p>Once your nutrigenetic report is available (usually within 4-6 weeks), a follow-up consultation is scheduled. Pierre Abou-Zeid explains your results in detail and, most importantly, translates them into practical, personalized nutritional and lifestyle recommendations integrated into your overall Diaeta plan, in line with our philosophy of pleasure and absence of restriction.</p>

                        A nutrigenetic test analyzes certain specific variations in your DNA (usually from a saliva sample) to identify how your genes can influence your response to food, your nutrient needs, and your predispositions to certain characteristics related to health and metabolism. The goal is not to diagnose diseases, but to provide information to personalize nutritional and lifestyle recommendations.

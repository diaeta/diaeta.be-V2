                                <li>Prioritize unsaturated fats (from olive oil, nuts, avocados) and omega-3s for heart health and satiety.</li>
                                <li>Use 'volume eating'—filling your plate with low-energy-density foods like vegetables—to feel full on fewer calories.</li>
                                <li>Employ smart satiety strategies like eating slowly, chewing thoroughly, and starting meals with protein and fiber.</li>
                                <li>Establish a consistent meal routine that fits your lifestyle to regulate appetite and prevent unplanned snacking.</li>
                                <li>Practice portion control and become label-savvy to avoid hidden calories and make informed food choices.</li>

                            <h2>Fats: Favor Healthy Fats (MUFA/PUFA) and Include Omega-3s</h2>
                            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The type of fat you eat is crucial for health. Unsaturated fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated) from sources like olive oil, nuts, avocados, and fatty fish can improve cholesterol and reduce inflammation. Omega-3s, in particular, support heart and brain health. While calorie-dense, these healthy fats also aid in satiety by slowing digestion.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Make wise swaps and practice portion awareness. Use olive oil for cooking, snack on a small handful of nuts, and try to include oily fish like salmon 1-2 times a week. Measure oils with a spoon rather than free-pouring to control calories. Don't fear fats; choose the right ones in reasonable amounts.</p>

                        <section id="energy-density">
                            <h2>Energy Density and 'Volume Eating'</h2>
                            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Energy density is the number of calories in a given weight of food. Low-energy-density foods (like vegetables and broth-based soups) allow you to eat a larger, more satisfying volume for fewer calories. This strategy of 'volume eating' helps you feel full while maintaining a calorie deficit, making dieting feel less restrictive.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Build meals around low-energy-density foods. A simple guide is the 'half-plate rule': make half of every meal non-starchy vegetables or a large salad. Start meals with a vegetable soup or salad to take the edge off hunger. This approach lets you eat a big plate of food, helping you feel psychologically and physically full.</p>

                        <section id="satiety-strategies">
                            <h2>Smart Satiety Strategies</h2>
                            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Managing hunger is key to successful weight loss. Beyond protein and fiber, other tactics can enhance satiety. Eating slowly and chewing thoroughly gives your brain time (about 20 minutes) to register fullness signals. Whole, intact foods (like an apple vs. apple juice) are more filling due to their fibrous structure.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Front-load meals with the most filling components: protein and vegetables. Eat slowly and mindfully, without distractions like TV. Choose foods that require active chewing. Incorporate water-rich foods like soups and salads, and drink water with meals. These strategies engineer fullness into your eating pattern, making calorie control easier.</p>

                        <section id="meal-timing">
                            <h2>Meal Structure and Timing (Finding a Consistent Routine)</h2>
                            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> While no single meal frequency is best for everyone, a structured, consistent routine is crucial. Inconsistent, chaotic eating often leads to unplanned snacking and overconsumption. A regular meal rhythm helps regulate appetite hormones and habits, whether you choose three square meals, smaller frequent meals, or time-restricted eating.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Choose a meal schedule that fits your life and stick to it 80-90% of the time. This structure reduces mindless grazing and decision fatigue. If late-night snacking is an issue, setting a simple rule like "no food after 8 pm" can be very effective. Consistency is key to creating a routine your body can rely on.</p>

                        <section id="portion-control">
                            <h2>Portion Control and Label Reading</h2>
                            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It's easy to consume far more calories than you realize due to oversized portions and deceptive food labels. Learning what appropriate portions look like and how to read nutrition labels empowers you to manage your intake accurately and avoid 'hidden' calories from sauces, drinks, and oversized servings.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Use measuring cups or a food scale at home for a while to train your eye. Use smaller plates to make portions appear more satisfying. When eating out, don't hesitate to leave food. Make a habit of checking the 'per 100g' nutrition info on packaged foods, paying close attention to calories, sugar, and serving sizes. Become a detective with portions and labels to put yourself in control.</p>

                            <h2>Warning Signs of Disordered Eating</h2>
                            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> While it's healthy to be mindful of your diet, this can sometimes cross a line into obsession and disordered eating. It's vital to be aware of the warning signs in yourself or others. A focus on health should enhance your life, not consume it.</p>
                            <p>Key warning signs can include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>An obsessive preoccupation with food, weight, calories, and dieting that disrupts daily life.</li>
                                <li>Intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image.</li>
                                <li>Restricting entire food groups, leading to a very rigid diet.</li>
                                <li>Feelings of extreme guilt or shame after eating certain foods.</li>
                                <li>Compulsive exercise, even when sick or injured, and feeling distressed if a workout is missed.</li>
                                <li>Withdrawing from social situations that involve food.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </section>

                        <section id="when-to-stop">
                            <h2>When to Stop and Seek Help</h2>
                            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Recognizing that your efforts have become harmful is the first step toward recovery. Prioritizing your mental and physical well-being is more important than achieving any specific weight goal. Continuing down a path of disordered eating can have severe health consequences.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> If you recognize several of the warning signs in your own behavior, it is time to pause your weight loss efforts and seek professional help. If your thoughts about food and your body are causing you significant distress, or if your eating habits are negatively impacting your relationships, work, or health, it is essential to speak with a healthcare professional.</p>

                            <h2>Referral Pathways</h2>
                            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> You do not have to go through this alone. There are trained professionals who can provide the support and treatment you need to develop a healthy relationship with food and your body. Knowing where to turn is a critical step.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Your first point of contact should be your general practitioner (doctor). They can assess your situation and refer you to the appropriate specialists, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or a dietitian who specializes in eating disorders. Seeking help is a brave and important step towards healing and well-being.</p>

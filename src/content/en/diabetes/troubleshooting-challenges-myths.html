                        <h2>Troubleshooting Common Challenges</h2>
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Challenge: "I'm always hungry."</h3>
                        <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> This often happens when a meal is high in refined carbs without enough protein, fat, or fiber. These three nutrients slow digestion and promote satiety. We can troubleshoot this by analyzing your meals to ensure they are balanced. Adding a source of lean protein, a healthy fat like avocado, or a serving of high-fiber vegetables can make a world of difference in keeping you full and satisfied.</p>

                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Challenge: "I gained weight after starting insulin."</h3>
                        <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is a frustrating but common experience for some. We acknowledge this challenge and strategize around it. This involves ensuring your meal plan is well-portioned and nutrient-dense, focusing on foods that provide high satiety to prevent overeating. We also emphasize physical activity to help build muscle, which improves insulin sensitivity. We will work in coordination with your doctor, who manages your medication regimen.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Challenge: "I struggle with emotional or stress eating."</h3>
                        <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is incredibly common, and it's important to approach it with compassion. We can work together to identify triggers for emotional eating. Sometimes, simply keeping a food and mood journal can reveal patterns you weren't aware of. We then develop alternative coping strategies, ensuring you have tools to manage stress that don't involve food, and create a plan that allows for occasional treats without guilt.</p>

                        <h2>Debunking Common Diabetes Myths</h2>
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Myth: "You have to follow a strict, joyless 'diabetic diet'."</h3>
                        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> This is one of the most persistent myths. As we've seen, there is no single "diabetes diet." The best approach is a balanced, enjoyable eating pattern that you can sustain. Understanding how different foods affect your blood sugar frees you from one-size-fits-all rules and allows you to eat with confidence and pleasure.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Myth: "You can never eat sugar or carbs again."</h3>
                        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> It's not about elimination; it's about moderation and quality. You can absolutely enjoy carbohydrates and even the occasional dessert. The key is to understand portion sizes, choose high-quality, high-fiber carbs when possible, and balance them with protein and fats to minimize their impact on your blood sugar.</p>

                        <h2>The "No Guilt, No Gimmicks" Mindset</h2>
                        <p>Your health journey is about progress, not perfection. It's crucial to treat weight and blood sugar numbers as just one piece of the puzzle, not the whole story. Your worth is not defined by these numbers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Stress and shame can raise blood sugar and derail your efforts. A compassionate approach is more effective and sustainable. We are here to encourage, not scold. If you stumble, we help you get back on track. We celebrate non-scale victories—like having more energy, sleeping better, or feeling more confident in your food choices—just as much as any number. This holistic, gentle approach lifts you up and supports lasting change.</p>

        <p class="intro-text">Diabetes is a group of conditions that affect how your body uses insulin—the hormone that helps move sugar (glucose) from your blood into your cells for energy. All types can lead to high blood sugar if not managed, but they differ in <strong>cause</strong>, <strong>who is affected</strong>, and <strong>how they’re treated</strong>. This page explains the main types in clear, everyday language. <em>(Educational content only—please speak with your healthcare provider for personal advice.)</em></p>

                        <p>Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Without insulin to help glucose enter the cells, blood sugar rises quickly. This makes lifelong insulin therapy essential to prevent dangerously high blood sugar levels and manage the condition effectively.</p>

                        <p>Representing over 90% of diabetes cases, Type 2 is a metabolic condition characterized by insulin resistance (where the body's cells don't respond effectively to insulin) and a relative lack of insulin. It is often linked to genetics, body weight, and lifestyle factors. T2D is progressive, but many individuals can manage it successfully with a personalized diet, increased physical activity, and, if needed, oral medications or insulin.</p>

                       <p>LADA is a slower-onset form of autoimmune diabetes that appears in adulthood and is often misdiagnosed as Type 2. It involves a gradual destruction of insulin-producing cells. Initially, oral medications might be effective, but as insulin production declines over time, insulin therapy will likely become necessary. Proactive and adaptive planning is key to managing LADA.</p>

                        <p>MODY is a rare, genetic form of diabetes caused by a mutation in a single gene, and it typically runs strongly in families. It often develops before the age of 25. Unlike Type 1, some subtypes of MODY may not require insulin and can be managed effectively with oral medications. A proper diagnosis through genetic testing is crucial to ensure the correct treatment approach is taken.</p>

It serves as a crucial warning sign. Without intervention, many people with prediabetes will progress to Type 2 diabetes. However, it's also a critical opportunity to act. Timely lifestyle changes can effectively prevent or delay its progression.</p>

                                <p>The simplest distinction is that Type 1 is an autoimmune condition where the body does not produce insulin, requiring lifelong insulin therapy.

                                <p>No, prediabetes is not technically a type of diabetes, but rather a critical warning sign. It means your blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough for a diabetes diagnosis. It represents a crucial opportunity to make lifestyle changes that can prevent or significantly delay the progression to Type 2 diabetes.</p>

                                <p>Diagnosing the correct type of diabetes involves a combination of factors. Clinicians look at your medical history, age of onset, and symptoms. They use blood tests to measure glucose and A1c levels, and may also use specific tests for autoantibodies (to identify autoimmune types like T1 or LADA) or C-peptide (to measure insulin production). In some cases, genetic testing may be used to confirm rare types like MODY.</p>

                                <p>Insulin is essential for life for everyone with Type 1 diabetes. People with LADA and Type 3c diabetes will also most likely require insulin as their condition progresses. Insulin may also be necessary for some people with Type 2 diabetes if lifestyle changes and other medications are not enough to control blood sugar, and it's sometimes used temporarily to manage gestational diabetes during pregnancy.</p>

                        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Effective diabetes management is not one-size-fits-all; it must be adapted to unique life stages and health conditions.</li>
                            <li>Specialized nutritional planning is crucial during pregnancy, for growing children, and for older adults to ensure safety and meet specific needs.</li>
                            <li>When diabetes co-exists with kidney or heart disease, a holistic nutrition plan is required to manage all conditions without conflict.</li>
                            <li>Cultural or religious practices like fasting can be safely incorporated into a diabetes plan with careful, coordinated guidance from your healthcare team.</li>

                        <h2>Pregnancy & Diabetes</h2>
                        <p>Managing blood sugar during pregnancy—whether it's pre-existing or gestational diabetes—requires extra care. Target glucose levels are tighter to protect the baby's health, and nutritional needs change as the pregnancy progresses. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to complications, but with the right support, healthy outcomes are absolutely achievable. We work closely with your OB/Gyn and endocrinologist to develop a nutrition plan that nourishes both you and your baby while keeping glucose levels on target, and we plan for postpartum follow-up to protect your long-term health.</p>

                    <section id="children-teens">
                        <h2>Children & Teens with Diabetes</h2>
                        <p>Young people face unique challenges, including growth spurts, hormonal changes, and the social pressures of school and sports. Management must support normal growth without making the child feel "different." We involve the whole family to create easy strategies for packed lunches, birthday parties, and sports. The focus is on age-appropriate education and building the child's confidence, empowering them to handle their diabetes as they move towards independence.</p>

                    <section id="older-adults">
                        <h2>Older Adults & Diabetes</h2>
                        <p>In older age, care priorities often shift. Preventing low blood sugars and maintaining quality of life can take precedence over achieving very tight glycemic control. Challenges like other health conditions, fixed incomes, or chewing difficulties must be considered. We focus on simplifying regimens and creating plans with easy-to-prepare, nutrient-dense foods to preserve muscle mass and prevent malnutrition, all while respecting personal preferences and independence.</p>

                    <section id="ckd-cvd">
                        <h2>Diabetes with Kidney or Heart Conditions (CKD/CVD)</h2>
                        <p>When diabetes co-exists with conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) or cardiovascular disease (CVD), you have to juggle multiple dietary recommendations (e.g., watching protein for kidneys, sodium for heart health). These needs can sometimes conflict with standard diabetes advice. We take a holistic view, coordinating with your specialists to create one cohesive, safe, and enjoyable plan that addresses all your health needs without contradiction.</p>

                    <section id="fasting">
                        <h2>Fasting & Feasting (Ramadan, Intermittent Fasting)</h2>
                        <p>Fasting for religious or personal reasons poses risks like hypoglycemia or dehydration. However, with careful guidance, most people can do it safely. If you intend to fast, we create a game plan in coordination with your doctor. This includes how to prepare for the fast with hydrating, sustaining foods, how to break the fast gently to avoid glucose spikes, and knowing the safety signs that mean you must stop fasting. This allows you to honor your beliefs while protecting your health.</p>

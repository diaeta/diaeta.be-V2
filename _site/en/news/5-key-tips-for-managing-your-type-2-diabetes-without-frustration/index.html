<p>Managing type 2 diabetes on a daily basis can seem like a major challenge, often associated with restrictive diets and frustration. At Diaeta, we are convinced that it is possible to regain control of your blood sugar while continuing to enjoy tasty and satisfying food. Here are 5 key tips, based on our scientific and personalized approach, to help you on this journey.</p>
<h2>1. Understand the Impact of Carbohydrates, Without Demonizing Them</h2>
<p>It is essential to understand how carbohydrates affect your blood sugar, but that doesn't mean eliminating them completely! The important thing is to choose the <strong>right types of carbohydrates</strong> and manage the <strong>portions</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Favor complex and fiber-rich carbohydrates</strong>: Sourdough whole-wheat breads, quinoa, oats, legumes, vegetables. They are digested more slowly, avoiding blood sugar spikes.</li>
<li><strong>Limit added sugars and refined carbohydrates</strong>: Sodas, candies, pastries, white bread.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to read labels</strong>: To identify hidden sources of sugar.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Diaeta, we teach you how to integrate carbohydrates intelligently to maintain your energy and enjoyment of eating.</p>
<h2>2. The Crucial Importance of Dietary Fiber</h2>
<p>Fiber is your ally! It slows down the absorption of glucose, improves insulin sensitivity, and promotes satiety.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aim for at least 25-30g of fiber per day</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent sources</strong>: Vegetables (broccoli, spinach, Brussels sprouts), fruits (berries, apples with the skin on), legumes (lentils, chickpeas), nuts, and seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate them gradually</strong>: To avoid digestive discomfort.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Don't Be Afraid of Good Fats</h2>
<p>Healthy fats are beneficial for cardiovascular health (often an issue with diabetes) and can help with satiety.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose unsaturated fats</strong>: Extra virgin olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds (flax, chia, sunflower), fatty fish (salmon, mackerel).</li>
<li><strong>Limit saturated fats</strong> (fatty meats, butter, whole dairy products) and <strong>avoid trans fats</strong> (present in some processed foods).</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Regular Physical Activity: An Essential Pillar</h2>
<p>Exercise helps your body use insulin more effectively and lower blood sugar.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week</strong> (brisk walking, cycling, swimming).</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate muscle-strengthening exercises</strong> 2 times a week.</li>
<li><strong>Find an activity you enjoy</strong> to maintain it over the long term.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Personalized Follow-up Makes All the Difference</h2>
<p>Everyone is unique, and diabetes management must be too. A &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; diet plan is rarely effective.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consult a dietitian-nutritionist</strong>: For a plan adapted to your needs, your preferences, your lifestyle, and your medical treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Regular follow-up</strong>: To adjust the plan, answer your questions, and maintain your motivation.</li>
<li><strong>Use of tools like the Nutrium app</strong>: Can facilitate the monitoring of your diet and communication with your healthcare professional.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At Diaeta, we are here to support you.</strong> Our goal is to give you the keys to manage your type 2 diabetes independently, effectively, and without frustration, by rediscovering the pleasure of healthy and delicious food.</p>

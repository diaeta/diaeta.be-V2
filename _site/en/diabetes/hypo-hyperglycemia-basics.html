                            <li>Recognizing the symptoms of both hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) is a critical life-saving skill.</li>
                            <li>Mild hypoglycemia can be treated if caught early, but severe hypoglycemia is a medical emergency.</li>
                            <li>Chronic hyperglycemia can cause long-term damage, and very high levels can lead to life-threatening emergencies like DKA or HHS.</li>

                        <h2>Recognizing Lows (Hypoglycemia)</h2>
                        <p>Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar level drops too low. It's crucial to recognize the symptoms early. Common signs include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shaking or trembling</li>
                            <li>Sweating and chills</li>
                            <li>Intense hunger</li>
                            <li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
                            <li>A fast heartbeat</li>
                            <li>Confusion or irritability</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If it worsens, symptoms can progress to blurry vision, clumsiness, slurred speech, and in severe cases, seizures or loss of consciousness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> While mild hypoglycemia can usually be self-treated if caught promptly, severe hypoglycemia is a medical emergency that can lead to coma or death if not addressed immediately. Quick recognition and action are literally life-saving.</p>

                    <section id="hyper">
                        <h2>Recognizing Highs (Hyperglycemia)</h2>
                        <p>Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar, often develops more slowly, and the initial signs can be subtle. Be aware of the following symptoms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Extreme thirst</li>
                            <li>Frequent urination</li>
                            <li>Fatigue or lethargy</li>
                            <li>Blurry vision</li>
                            <li>Headaches</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Very high blood sugar is a serious concern. It may lead to fruity-smelling breath, nausea, vomiting, and rapid breathing (potential signs of Diabetic Ketoacidosis or DKA, especially in Type 1), or extreme dehydration and confusion (a possible Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State or HHS, more common in Type 2).</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Untreated hyperglycemia over time causes damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. Extremely high levels can lead to DKA or HHS, which are life-threatening emergencies that require immediate hospitalization. Knowing the red flags allows you to seek help early and prevent severe outcomes.</p>

                        <h2>Your Safety Plan</h2>
                        <p>Feeling unsure about handling blood sugar swings can be scary and can derail your progress. Knowledge is your best tool for building confidence and peace of mind. It's essential to work with your healthcare provider to create a clear, personalized action plan.</p>
                        <p><strong>What we'll do together:</strong> We will reinforce your understanding of your personal symptoms for both highs and lows. While we do not create treatment protocols, we will ensure you are confident in the plan provided by your doctor. This includes discussing when to use prescribed treatments (like glucose tablets or glucagon), when to call your doctor, and which symptoms mean you should seek emergency medical help (e.g., moderate ketones, vomiting, confusion). We will also focus on prevention strategies, such as meal timing around medication and exercise, to help you feel safer in your daily routine.</p>

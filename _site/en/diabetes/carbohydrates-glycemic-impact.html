                        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The quality of carbohydrates (e.g., high-fiber, whole grains) is often more important than the quantity, as they lead to gentler blood sugar rises.</li>
                            <li>Fiber, protein, and healthy fats act as "brakes" on glucose absorption, preventing sharp spikes and keeping you feeling full longer.</li>
                            <li>Mastering the art of a balanced plate, where carbs are paired with these other macronutrients, is key to stable energy levels.</li>
                            <li>The Glycemic Index (GI) is a useful tool for making smarter food swaps, but it should be used as a flexible guide, not a strict rulebook.</li>

                        <h2>Carbohydrates & Blood Sugar</h2>
                        <p>Carbohydrates, which include starches and sugars found in foods like bread, pasta, fruit, and sweets, are the nutrients that most directly raise blood glucose levels as they are digested. However, not all carbs are created equal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The quality of the carbohydrates you eat can matter as much as the quantity. Whole grains and high-fiber carbs (like brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread) are digested more slowly. This leads to a gentler, more predictable rise in blood sugar. In contrast, refined and sugary carbs (like white bread, soda, and candy) can cause your levels to spike quickly, leading to a "roller-coaster" effect.</p>

                    <section id="fiber">
                        <h2>Fiber’s Friendly Role</h2>
                        <p>Fiber, a type of carbohydrate found in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes, is your ally in diabetes management. Because your body doesn't digest it into sugar, it plays a crucial role in slowing down the absorption of other carbohydrates from your meal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> High-fiber meals result in a more gradual increase in blood glucose, preventing sharp spikes. Furthermore, fiber helps you feel full longer, which can aid in weight management and improve cholesterol levels. Including a variety of fiber-rich foods is a simple, delicious way to smooth out blood sugar swings while keeping your meals satisfying.</p>

                    <section id="protein-fats">
                        <h2>The Stabilizing Power of Protein & Healthy Fats</h2>
                        <p>Lean proteins (like fish, chicken, tofu, and legumes) and healthy fats (found in olive oil, nuts, seeds, and avocado) have a minimal immediate impact on your blood sugar levels. Their real power lies in their ability to work in synergy with carbohydrates.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Adding protein and fat to a meal effectively puts the "brakes" on glucose absorption by slowing down digestion. This blunts the glucose spike you might otherwise get from eating carbohydrates alone. This combination also promotes satiety, helping you feel full and nourished for longer, and helps preserve muscle mass. Crafting meals that pair carbs with these nutrients is a cornerstone of keeping blood sugars steady.</p>

                    <section id="low-gi">
                        <h2>The Low-Glycemic Index (Low-GI) Approach</h2>
                        <p>The Glycemic Index (GI) is a tool that ranks carbohydrate-containing foods based on how quickly they raise blood glucose levels. Foods with a low GI (like lentils, berries, and dense seeded bread) cause a slower, lower rise in blood sugar compared to high-GI foods (like white rice, potatoes, and sugary cereals).</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A low-GI eating pattern has been shown to improve glycemic control and can support weight management by preventing the sharp spikes and subsequent crashes that can drive hunger. It empowers you to make smarter swaps. However, the GI should be used as a flexible guide, not a rigid set of rules. We can teach you how to identify low-GI choices and incorporate them into flavorful meals that love your blood sugar back.</p>

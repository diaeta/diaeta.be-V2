                        <ul>
                            <li>Your dietitian acts as an expert ally and partner, working alongside you and your doctor to create a cohesive and effective care plan.</li>
                            <li>The first consultation is a thorough, judgment-free deep dive into your unique story, lifestyle, and goals to build a strong foundation of trust.</li>
                            <li>With your consent, your dietitian coordinates with your medical team to ensure consistent messaging and safe care, especially regarding medication adjustments.</li>
                            <li>Care is evidence-based, patient-centered, and ethically sound, with a focus on empowering you with knowledge and support, not selling products.</li>

                        <h2>First Consultation: Warm & Thorough</h2>
                        <p>The journey begins with a relaxed, 60-minute deep dive where we get to know you. This isn't a lecture; it's a conversation. We'll discuss your story with diabetes, your daily routine, eating habits, challenges, and aspirations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> You are the expert on your own life. Understanding your world fully is essential to tailoring advice that actually fits. A thorough first visit allows us to build a strong foundation of trust and create a personalized strategy from day one, rather than offering generic, band-aid solutions. By the end of our first session, we will set 1-3 achievable initial goals together, and you will leave with a clear, empowering plan.</p>

                    <section id="coordination">
                        <h2>Coordination With Your Doctor & Privacy</h2>
                        <p>A dietitian operates as part of your healthcare team, not in isolation. With your explicit consent, we communicate with your GP or endocrinologist, providing them with relevant notes on your nutrition care plan and progress. This team-based approach ensures you receive consistent messages and the safest possible care.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Coordinated care prevents confusion and closes gaps. If we notice a pattern that might require a medication adjustment, we can flag it for your doctor. Likewise, we reinforce and build your nutrition plan around any changes your doctor makes. Your privacy is paramount; we strictly adhere to all medical privacy laws (like GDPR in the EU), and no information is shared without your permission.</p>

                    <section id="follow-up">
                        <h2>Follow-Up Cadence & Ongoing Support</h2>
                        <p>Diabetes management is a dynamic process, not a one-time fix. After our initial consultation, we'll meet for shorter follow-up sessions at a frequency that suits your needsâ€”often bi-weekly or monthly to start. These sessions are for troubleshooting, providing accountability, and continuing your education.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Regular check-ins help you sustain momentum, adapt your plan as your life changes, and solve small issues before they become big problems. Studies show that ongoing support improves health outcomes and builds confidence in self-care. Between visits, we offer check-in support to ensure you never feel alone on your journey.</p>

                        <h2>Credibility & Reassurance: Why You're in Good Hands</h2>
                        <p>Our guidance is always grounded in the latest scientific evidence and aligned with respected clinical guidelines from organizations like the American and Belgian Diabetes Associations. We are committed to continuous training and staying updated on the latest research.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> You deserve advice that is proven to be safe and effective. Evidence-based medical nutrition therapy has been shown in studies to lower HbA1c by 1-2%. Furthermore, we practice with strict ethical standards. We do not sell products and have no conflicts of interest. Our sole focus is your wellbeing, which means setting realistic expectations, maintaining confidentiality, and always respecting your personal choices and values. You can trust that the plan we create together is a personalized implementation of what works.</p>
